Great question! Let’s clear up the purpose of:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote add upstream <remote-url>
And whether it's mandatory or not.

✅ Why This Step Is Important
This step is only necessary if you forked someone else’s repository on GitHub.

🔄 When it's used:
You cloned your fork (e.g., origin)

You add upstream to link the original repo (the one you forked from)

This lets you:

Pull updates from the original project (upstream)

Keep your fork in sync with the original repo

❓ What if you don’t run this step?
📌 If you're working on your own repo:
You don’t need upstream

You can push your code to GitHub just fine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
📌 If you forked a repo but never add upstream:
You can still push to your fork (origin)

But you can’t pull changes from the original repo (upstream) unless you add it manually

✅ So, to answer directly:
Scenario	Can you push to GitHub?	Is upstream needed?
You created your own GitHub repo	✅ Yes	❌ Not needed
You forked someone else’s repo	✅ Yes (to your fork)	✅ Useful (not required)
You want to sync with original repo	❌ Not easily	✅ Required

✅ Summary:
git remote add upstream is not required to push your code

It is very helpful if you're working with forked repos and want to stay up to date with the original source
